Currently, I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Purdue University, working under the guidance of [Prof. Chunyi Peng](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/chunyi/). My research interests center around mobile computing and computer vision, with a specific focus on designing efficient mobile vision systems. I have recently been focused on developing autonomous drone delivery systems.

Prior to joining Purdue, I have completed a Master's degree in 2021 from Columbia University and a Bachelor's degree in 2019 from Wuhan University.
